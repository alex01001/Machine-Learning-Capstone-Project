# Machine Learning for Intraday Stock Trading

In this project, I research applicability of Machine Learning methods to intraday stock market trading. Specifically, I focus on evaluating so-called “Demand Zones” in terms of their potential profitability. I’ve built a system which tracks the S&P 500 stock data, detects the Demand Zones (let’s refer to this moment of time as _T1_), records the technical parameters, including the peak price (at time _T2_), and generates alerts when the price comes back to the demand zone (time _T3_). 

At the time _T3_, a trader (or a trading algorithm) has to make a decision whether they should buy the stock. The purpose of my research is to analyze the performance of Machine Learning algorithms in terms of their ability to correctly predict the winning trades.
